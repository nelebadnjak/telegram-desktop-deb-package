# Telegram Desktop deb package


Everybody sane hates flatpack, snap and similar packages, so, this repo automatically fetch new versions of [Telegram Desktop](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop) and build .deb package.

```bash
wget https://github.com/nelebadnjak/telegram-desktop-deb-package/releases/download/4.8.3/telegram_desktop_4.8.3_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i telegram_desktop_4.8.3_amd64.deb
./opt/Telegram/Telegram

```


There is plan to create Debian/Ubuntu repository.
